# LoBotHouse (Implementation of a Robotic Automation Process System Using ROS2)  

**A collaborative robot (cobot) for construction that supports labor-intensive tasks and mitigates high accident risks on site** **from Doosan Robotics Rokey Bootcamp3 in 2025**

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Overview
This project utilizes the Doosan collaborative robot M0609 to symbolically implement and prototype key construction functions commissioned by government or enterprise clients. The robot interprets architectural blueprints, performs construction tasks accordingly, and detects defective materials, offering a proof-of-concept system for automated building assistance.
